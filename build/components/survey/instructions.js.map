The first two games are idea generation games and will be completed in groups of 5 people. These games will have 3 stages: First there is the Game stage then the Similarity stage, and finally the Favourites stage.'\n            +'\\nThe format of the first two games is as follows: \\n\\n'\n            +'\\nGame 1 & 2 = Completion round, Similarities round, and Favourites round'\n            +'\\nCompletion Round: First you will be asked to complete the game itself. Though you will be in a group of 5, you will be working on your own to complete the game. You will be asked to generate ideas based on the instructions given to you. All your entries (i.e. ideas) will be shown to the group during the round, and your ranking will be shown at the end of Game 1.'\n            +'\\nSimilarities Round: Group entries from the Completion Round will be randomly sent to other groups. You will read all of the group’s entries and name any that you think are similar to each other. '\n            +'\\nAn example of how similarity can be judged will be given, but it is up to each judge to decide whether entries are similar.'\n            +'\\nIf any entries are found to be similar by at least 2 people in the group then the entry that was entered last will be excluded from the Favourites Round. Thus the original entry will be the only one to advance to the Favourites Round. Remember, only look for similar entries from the list given to you, without taking into account entries from your own group.'\n            +'\\nThe same rule will apply to your entries from the Completion round. If your entry is seen to be similar to another already existing entry then it will then be excluded from the Favourites.'\n            +'\\nFavourites Round: You will vote for the favourite entries from the Similarities round. The person whose work was favorited the most is judged to have performed the best, and the person whose was favorited the least is judged to perform the worst.  Players will not be paid based on their performance. The other group will not know how you voted or which entries were thought to be similar and by whom. This means your actions in the first two rounds will have no effect on how others view or favourite your entries in both Games 1&2. '\n            +'\\nFinal Game: The Final game will be completed individually. No one will be able to see other group members’ entries.
